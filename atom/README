_ LDA (PW, VWN)
_ GGA (PBE, PW91, BLYP)
_ potential-only meta-GGA (BJ, RPP)
_ hybrid functionals (PBE0, B3LYP)
_ screened hybrid functionals (HSE03, HSE06)
_ HF+GW
_ DFT+GW
_ Hybrid+GW
_ QPscGW
_ HF+MP2
_ DFT+MP2
_ Hybrid+MP2
_ QSscMP2
_ CI for 2 electrons 


Installation:

MOLGW needs fortran, c and c++ compilers.
The machine dependent variables should be set in file ~molgw/src/my_machine.arch

* Blas and Lapack linear algebra libraries are required.
* libint is required:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/libint/files/libint-for-beginners/libint-2.0.0-prealpha.tgz/download
* libxc is required:
http://www.tddft.org/programs/octopus/down.php?file=libxc/libxc-1.2.0.tar.gz


Basis sets:
Basis sets can be obtained from https://bse.pnl.gov/bse/portal
The file can be generated from a NWChem file using the script
./util/basis_nwchem2molgw.py B_aug-cc-pVDZ.nwchem


Usage:
The basis file needs to be located in the working directory.
./molgw < helium.in > helium.out

Example input files can be found in ./tests/


To be done:
* filter the vanishing gaussian integrals so to save memory
* pseudopotentials (e.g. ECP or Goedecker flavor)
* implement Casida equations to halve the matrix


Issues:
* QPscGW scf loop is quite unstable for large basis sets, use a low alpha (<= 0.50)
