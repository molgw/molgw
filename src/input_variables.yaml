# This file is a part of MOLGW
# This is a yaml file that contains all the input variables of MOLGW.
# The variables are sorted by their families and, within families, by alphabetic order.
#
#============================================================================
#
# If you want to add a *new variable*, this is THE only file you have to modify.
#
# Then you will have to run the python script ~molgw/utils/input_variables.py just once.
# It will generate all the necessary fortran, html files automatically.
#
# To add a new variable, select a correponding family of variables and follow the yaml syntax (used for any other variable in this file).
#
#============================================================================
# To read this file by your python script, do the following:
#
# from yaml   import load,dump
# try:
#     from yaml import CLoader as Loader, CDumper as Dumper
# except ImportError:
#     from yaml import Loader, Dumper
#
# with open(input_variables.yaml, 'r') as stream:
#     input_variables = load(stream,Loader=Loader)
#
# Then, input_variables is a python dictionary that contains all the input variables.
#
#
#============================================================================
# The families of variables are:
#
# [general]      General input variables
# [hardware]     Hardware input variables (Parallelization)
# [io]           IO input variables
# [io_rt_tddft]  IO Real time TDDFT

    For Dunning sets, use aug-cc-pVTZ for instance. Note
    that Pople sets are to be used with gaussian_type='cart' One may use ones own
    basis sets provided that the files are labeled X_mybasisset where X is the element.
    Use 'even_tempered' for a systematic even-tempered basis.

ecp_type:
  family: general
  datatype: characters
  mandatory: 'no'
  experimental: 'no'
  default: ''

Setting this variable to yes will produce WFN files for ground-state calculations as well as for GW-corrected densities. Note: currently, only cartesian basis are supported.'

  comment: 'Prints a small RESTART file at each SCF cycle. There are two kinds of
    RESTART files: the small RESTART and the big RESTART. The former contains only
    the information about the occupied wavefunctions. This is a very small file and

read_fchk:
  family: io
  datatype: characters
  mandatory: 'no'
  experimental: 'no'
  default: 'no'
  comment: Triggers the reading of an external Gaussian formatted checkpoint file
    (named gaussian.fchk) that contains density matrices. Basis sets have to be precisely
    the same in MOLGW and in Gaussian, which requires a manual input of the basis
    set in both codes. Options are 'no' (no reading), 'SCF' (for self-consistent field),
    'CC' (for coupled-cluster), or 'MP2' (for MP2). Today, only works for Cartesian
    Gaussian and for spin restricted calculations.

eta:

  comment: Is a the tiny imaginary part used in the denominator of the Green's function
    to shift the pole off the axis, so to avoid divergences.This is an energy in Hartree.
    It should be set to the lowest value possible in theory. However, in practice,
    a too low value of eta would induce huge and unstable GW corrections. The default
    value is usually very accurate and there is no need to use a lower value. But
    for states apart from the band gap, a large value of eta may be beneficial for
    stability. eta=0.01 is already much more stable. Note that for QSGW increasing
    eta is most often unavoidable.

  mandatory: 'no'
  experimental: 'no'
  default: 'angstrom'
  comment: Chooses the units of the atomic coordinates. Can be 'angstrom' or 'bohr'.
    Could be abbreviated in 'A' or 'au'.

magnetization:
  family: system
  datatype: real
  mandatory: 'no'
  experimental: 'no'
  default: 0.0
  comment: Sets the number of unpaired electrons. In other words, this is the difference
    between the spin up and spin down occupation. For instance, a spin-doublet calculation
    is obtained with magnetization=1.0. Only meaningful when nspin=2.

natom:
  family: system
  datatype: integer
  mandatory: 'no'
  experimental: 'no'
  default: 0
  comment: Sets the number of atoms in the molecule. This is the number of lines to
    be read in the following section of the input file if no xyz file is provided.

nghost:
  family: system
  datatype: integer
  mandatory: 'no'
  experimental: 'no'
  default: 0
  comment: Sets the number of ghost atoms in the molecule. Used to place basis function
    where there is no atom. Useful for Basis Set Superposition Error

nspin:
  family: system
  datatype: integer
  mandatory: 'no'
  experimental: 'no'
  default: 1
  comment: Sets the number of spin channels. 1 enforces spin-restricted calculations.
    2 means spin-unrestricted.

temperature:
  family: system
  datatype: real
  mandatory: 'no'
  experimental: 'no'
  default: 0.0
  comment: Sets the electronic temperature in the Fermi-Dirac functions. Helps the
    convergence for some systems. The value is input in Hartree atomic units.

xyz_file:
  family: system
  datatype: characters
  mandatory: 'no'
  experimental: 'no'
  default: ''
  comment: Specifies the location of the xyz file that contains the atomic positions.
    It can be used as an alternate route to set atomic coordinate.
